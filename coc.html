            <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
              <h4>Anti-Harassment Policy</h4>
                     <p>This event is intended to be a welcoming, supportive, and comfortable space for all participants, and we will work to make it a harassment-free environment. We will not tolerate harassment in any form. </p>
                    <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, country of origin, age, disability, physical appearance, body size, religion, veteran status or other protected class status; discriminatory or offensive images in public spaces; intimidation; stalking; harassing or unwanted photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants violating the anti-harassment policy may be warned or asked to leave by the event organizers.</p>

              <h4>Recording/Social Media Policy</h4>
                    <p>We see this event as a place to share information and build community, not only with other participants, but also with those who may not be able to attend. The event is, by default, considered open and can be written about on social media and photographed. If you do not want your picture taken, your words to be recorded or for either photographs or words to be attributed to you, please let other participants know that. As a courtesy, please always ask prior to creating sound or video recordings of any portion of this event. Please be thoughtful and respectful with your photographs, recording, and sharing.</p>

              <h4>Reporting Harassment or Violations</h4>
                    <p>If at any point during the event you feel uncomfortable or harassed, or if you witness any violations of these policies, please do not hesitate to reach out to Sveta Stoytcheva (stoytch@hawaii.edu) or anyone who introduces themselves at the start of the day as an event organizer.</p>
